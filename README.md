Linux System Toolbox App

This app started from inspiration from Dave Plummer's video on writing Windows Task Manager as a handy app to use for development, which was later added to Windows as the Ctrl-Alt-Del function. You can find his video on his YouTube channel Dave's Garage: https://www.youtube.com/c/DavesGarage

I chose to build the initial version of this app as a way to learn TKinter and master the linux CLI. Further versions will introduce better, programmatic methods and remove the CLI command use.

This app is in NO way built the best way possible!!!
